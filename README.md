# The-Hangman-Game
Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters or numbers, within a certain number of guesses. Here the computer chooses a word at random from a given list of words. This word is the answer. The player then tries to guess the word, by guessing one letter at a time. Whenever the user guesses a letter that is in the answer, all occurrences of that letter are revealed to the user. The game ends when the user has guessed every letter in the word, before he reaches the allowed number of strikes (usually 5). This program is an interactive Hangman game. The focus is to use and manipulate strings and loops.
